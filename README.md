# The-Last-Assignment

A text-based adventure game in which you explore a closed down university looking for a computer so that you can finish your last school assignment before the deadline comes. All universities including your own have shut down because of a viral pandemic that plagues the land, so the build should - in theory - be empty.

Explore the now-abondoned halls of the university, befriend robots, rescue lab animals, and uncover the mysteries of the top-secret research that took place in the labs in this 2-3 hour adventure. But beware, as the university might not be as abandoned as advertised.

## Note

This game is based off of our submission for the RPG assignment for the Object Oriented Programming course at the University of Groningen. We fixed some bugs and added some more story elements and this upload is now a submission of the OOP Contest. Some bugs are probably still present in the game since we did not have a lot of time to playtest it. A lot of planned features are still missing.

If you have any feedback please [submit a github issue](https://github.com/blat-blatnik/The-Last-Assignment/issues/new). We welcome all feedback you can give.

We hope you enjoy the game! :)
