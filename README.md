# The-Last-Assignment

A text-based adventure game in which you explore a closed down university looking for a computer so that you can finish your last school assignment before the deadline comes. All universities including your own have shut down because of a viral pandemic that plagues the land, so the build should - in theory - be empty.

Explore the now-abondoned halls of the university, befriend robots, rescue lab animals, and uncover the mysteries of the top-secret research that took place in the labs in this 2-3 hour adventure. But beware, as the university might not be as abandoned as advertised.
